My first small tamagotchi game. I wanted to make something simple with the knowledge I have right now, to see what I could do. I choose a tamagotchi-like style because I wanted to somehow commemorate my cat that passed away in Summer 2019. RIP Gato :crying_cat_face:	

 *	A simple virtual pet game where you can care for a cat that has 4 needs: happiness (play to refill), hunger (feed to refill), hygiene (clean to refill) and energy (send to sleep to refill).
 *	Interact with the pet via mouse input. Every need can be interacted with in a room designed for it, e.g living room to play, kitchen to feed, bathroom to clean and bedroom to sleep.
 *	Needs slowly go down overtime, but the pet cannot die.
